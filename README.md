Briks99 is an Indian online real estate marketplace which is a subsidiary of Zillow. It facilitates buyers and renters to find homes and neighborhoods across the United States through recommendations, local insights, and map overlays that offer details on commutes, schools, churches, and nearby businesses.

In this project, We have tried to make a FULL-STACK project by manipulating dom elements using REACT, manage state changes using REDUX, CHAKRA UI Library, style using CSS in react, styled components, and tried to make a responsive website and implement dynamic routing to persist data. We have managed our database globally using MongoDB Atlas and Express. With the self-learning efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned till Unit-6 in the Masai School, we were able to clone the whole website with the same looks & features.

This is a collaborative project built within 5 days by a team of 4 members 

-->  Saurabh Bhatt ( Team Lead ) --> BackEnd with some frontend page


-->  Md Abdul Qadir --> Landing Page, Login / Signup page.


-->  Shubham Singh  --> All Product Page, Single Product Page.


-->  Ganesh Bahera  --> Admin Side.

## End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project, we have tried to achieve a near-to-perfect clone of the original website images provided as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the actual website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and the functionality of the website is achieved.
